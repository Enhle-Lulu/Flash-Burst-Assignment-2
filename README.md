REPORT:
I have developed an app that helps identify your weak points in History using flashcards. It will give a score at the end based on the amount of questions you got correct or incorrect. It has about 12 different questions with ones that are easy to answer but also some that require a little bit of brain work, if the user knows the work they should be okay. Although itâ€™s only 12 questions it still gives the user enough questions to practice.
